# New Product Introduction Tool for Product Managers

This website shows current and completed products that have been presented to a company. 
Within every product there are checklists which show a product's specifics. 

Specifics include where they come from, how much they cost, other prototypes, documentation, etc. 
These checklists allow a project manager to see the progress of their product.
