# New Product Introduction Tool for Product Managers

## The Purpose
The intent of this website is for Product Managers to track open projects and to propose new projects.
Within every product, there are details that include product specifics.
Specifics include where they come from, how much they cost, other prototypes, documentation, etc. 
These checklists allow a project manager to see the progress of their product.


### Below are screenshots of the website's POC.
